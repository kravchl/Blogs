## Multi-Tussles

  The concept of tussle, just another word for conflict resolution really, posed by Clark in this paper revolves around the idea that different actors that utilize the Internet have different needs or uses for the Internet. The paper goes into detail describing the framework from the birth of the Internet and its end-to-end application development to where we are now. The Internet now while seemingly endless in nature, can still be affected to change as actors with different motives of use enter its realm. The multi-tussle idea that expands on Clark's framework points out that there are multiple conflicts of interest between actors within the Internet's development. These conflicts are not limited to technological needs but cover cultural needs and differences. 
  
  I believe the underlying thought being made is how growing technology, in this case the entirety of the Internet, should be done with respect to a multitude of factors. I would agree that making a bit of software without considering the implications it may have is foolish. I would say the paper covers these implications in a very robust way, offering an almost philosophical approach to technology. 
  
###  To be technology or not to be. 

## Degrees of Freedom, Dimensions of Power

 The Internet has come a long way with the fundamental design being decentralization, we now find ourselves battling with big business objectives and a much more centralized design. Companies that provide Internet access have a scary amount of power in their hands. Privately owned, they can impose their power on a whim, provided there are no laws against it - which in the technologic expansion we're in now, are ever-growing. The article describes this potential imbalance of power as companies seek to structure and perfect their systems from unlawful users which is in direct conflict with the original Internet design. 
  
  While it may be obvious that a strictly wild west approach to the Internet would be disastrous, it was in this state of chaos that allowed for innovation and expansion. Powered with curiosity and freedom, software developers were able to work without restrictions in mind. However, malicious users could also impose this freedom to do harm. The difficulty in the direction the Internet must go falls under a struggle of power between freedom and regulations that restrict them. Allowing too much centralization of Internet power stifles the growth of technology, while not enough enables malicious users to do more harm.
  
  In a perfect world, there wouldn't be bad people. Unfortunately, there are more than people would like to consider. Ultimately, with enough power, it only takes one person to break everything if fail safes and protection aren't in place. 
  
  The paper goes on to expand on social influencers and the power in which they can impose on their users. Facebook has immense behavioral analysis tools that they can use to affect what their users do. Through sheer numbers testing, they can put themselves in a position of power that rivals ISPs. They are an example of how a centralization of data can provide power to a single entity that could prove dangerous in the wrong hands.
  
   The power of data is scary as in previous versions of the Internet, anonymity was almost gauranteed. Now, we find government agencies able to tap into data stashed away that could identify us online by just the behavior of our Internet usage. 
  
  The Internet is a scary, complex, and ever-developing place. We must tread lightly as a whole and not allow for big business to gain complete control over it. Their intentions are rooted in a desire to protect their assets and not necessarily to protect the users. A fully decentralized approach is again, foolish, but the basic principle should remain to provide the freedoms of innovation that built the Internet in the first place. 
  
 ## The Contingent Internet
 
  This paper has a similar to theme to the one above. The author poses the question at first whether it's possible for the Internet to not have developed. As if to consider an alternate dimension in which the world was not connected via near instantaneous communcation. It would appear that the Internet was inevitable. 
  
  The experience of the Internet is becoming more diverse and more accessible. Increases in usage means increases in risk to its users. Providing universal protection such as encryption to the users is certainly possible, however not entirely implimented as companies still want to track users to provide customized experiences as well as safety reasons to prevent malicious users. Again, we find ourselves with the problem of aloting the power from ISPs to users. Who should get what rights?

## Surveillance & Society

  In our growing networked world, the need for privacy is more important than ever, but the boundaries on what and who this privacy applies to isn’t well defined. Submitting DNA into a laboratories data base not only exposed one’s personal data into the world, but their immediate family as well as potential future kids. It’s data such as this that is being used to provide personalized experiences on the web for individuals. The more data our computer systems have on us, the more related content we will receive. 
  
  The problem in present society is that this data harvesting often goes unnoticed and borderline without our full consent. We may agree to lengthy terms and conditions, but rarely do people truly understand what they’re putting out into the world by simply browsing social media and clicking on a few links. They have reason to be frustrated when at points they’re feeling stalked when visiting a certain website starts a chain of related ads in their searches and social media pages. These stalker ads are harmless enough, but the question of what exactly is being tracked and to what extent comes up at one point or another. 
  
  One can combat these fancy behavior analysis algorithms using insider content that only people within one’s own social circle would understand, but that content is being tracked, nonetheless. Simply not using certain platforms known for their heavy tracking could be an option, but to not use a widely used platform alienates those afraid for their privacy and limits their use of the internet. We may be reaching a point where anything being done on the Internet is tracked by someone or another and where law must be stringently put in place to prevent it.
  
## Security & Privacy as a Social and Cultural Phenomenon 
  
 Security is often directly thought of as a tech specific concept. Where there is security, there must be some fancy tech. Privacy on the otherhand is a socially constructed concept. It's arrived to by societies mutual agreement, often agreed upon through common law, that a concept, process, or thought is to remain secret and only be available to those within the circle of inclusion. These secrets vary culturally and among different social groups. 
 
  A group of teenages for example, share secrets in their social groups with a silently agreement that it shouldn't be shared with outsiders. However, with technology secrets are harder to keep secret. So, it is then that security plays a role in allowing for these secrets to hold their integrity as they would have in the physical world. We must then consider that security is not simply a technical feature to impliment, but rather a feature that comes out of the necessity to faciliate the traditional social consideration better known as privacy.
  
## Trust vs Trustworthiness
  
  Trust is mistakingly used to describe trustworthiness and vice versa. The two differ in meaning as well as intent when attempting to instill either in the tech world. As the old saying goes, trust is something that is earned. This stands true on the Internet as well. In order for trust to be built in say, a particular website, there must be an exchange of reliance that over repeated success, forms the chains of trust we traditionally understand between people. To say I trust a website, means that the person has had a history of success in using that website. 
  
  Trustworthiness by contrast is the expectation that a website is going to be able to perform and allow for the building of trust to occur. This expectation can arise from assurances linked to the website in the form of other well known websites or people advocating positively for the site. These assurances often provide a quicker route to building trust, but as the article points out, that trust is broken easier if those assurances hadn't been there to help with process.
  
  To say I trust technology should be understood as trust in the developers, as saying piece of technology programmed to perform tasks is trustworthy doesn't align with the meaning of the word. Understanding how people build trust and have certain expectations of trustworthiness helps in the development of technology. The more people trust a technology, the more willing they will be to invest their time and money into it.

## This World of Ours

  The author seems very cynical of the security needs of the world and accurately descibes why he is. Asking for improved encryption that make for single sentence messages with 95% added encryption overhead is overkill. The needs for encryption has it's place. I got the sense that the author was almost advocating for just enough security to prevent people from getting hacked by most attempt, provided they don't click on that link, and that getting hacked from that experienced computer savant is unsecurable and attempting so would be futile. 
  
  The world isn't ready for people to adopt concepts of encryption in their everyday lives if they're the ones that have to implement it. Getting the next generation interested is difficult at best, and as such the approach on security should be with all that in mind. The majority of computer users aren't informed and many will click the link to win a new iPad. So, forces such harsh encryption improvements when people click the link anyways seems pointless.
  
## Why Johnny Can't Encrypt

  The paper follows a scientific case study performed on the usability of PGP 5.0 and it's ease of use for novice computer users.
