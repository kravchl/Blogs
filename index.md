## Multi-Tussles

  The concept of tussle, just another word for conflict resolution really, posed by Clark in this paper revolves around the idea that different actors that utilize the Internet have different needs or uses for the Internet. The paper goes into detail describing the framework from the birth of the Internet and its end-to-end application development to where we are now. The Internet now while seemingly endless in nature, can still be affected to change as actors with different motives of use enter its realm. The multi-tussle idea that expands on Clark's framework points out that there are multiple conflicts of interest between actors within the Internet's development. These conflicts are not limited to technological needs but cover cultural needs and differences. 
  
  I believe what the objective of the paper is to point out how growing technology, in this case the entirety of the Internet, should be done with respect to a multitude of factors. I would agree that making a bit of software without considering the implications it may have is foolish. I would say the paper covers these implicatios in a very roundabout way, offering an almost philosophical approach to technology.
