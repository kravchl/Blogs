## Multi-Tussles

  The concept of tussle, just another word for conflict resolution really, posed by Clark in this paper revolves around the idea that different actors that utilize the Internet have different needs or uses for the Internet. The paper goes into detail describing the framework from the birth of the Internet and its end-to-end application development to where we are now. The Internet now while seemingly endless in nature, can still be affected to change as actors with different motives of use enter its realm. The multi-tussle idea that expands on Clark's framework points out that there are multiple conflicts of interest between actors within the Internet's development. These conflicts are not limited to technological needs but cover cultural needs and differences. 
  
  I believe the underlying thought being made is how growing technology, in this case the entirety of the Internet, should be done with respect to a multitude of factors. I would agree that making a bit of software without considering the implications it may have is foolish. I would say the paper covers these implications in a very robust way, offering an almost philosophical approach to technology.

## Degrees of Freedom, Dimensions of Power

 The Internet has come a long way with the fundamental design being decentralization, we now find ourselves battling with big business objectives and a much more centralized design. Companies that provide Internet access have a scary amount of power in their hands. Privately owned, they can impose their power on a whim, provided there are no laws against it - which in the technologic expansion we're in now, are ever-growing. The article describes this potential imbalance of power as companies seek to structure and perfect their systems from unlawful users which is in direct conflict with the original Internet design. 
  
  While it may be obvious that a strictly wild west approach to the Internet would be disastrous, it was in this state of chaos that allowed for innovation and expansion. Powered with curiosity and freedom, software developers were able to work without restrictions in mind. However, malicious users could also impose this freedom to do harm. The difficulty in the direction the Internet must go falls under a struggle of power between freedom and regulations that restrict them. Allowing too much centralization of Internet power stifles the growth of technology, while not enough enables malicious users to do more harm.
  
  In a perfect world, there wouldn't be bad people. Unfortunately, there are more than people would like to consider. Ultimately, with enough power, it only takes one person to break everything if fail safes and protection aren't in place. 
  
  The paper goes on to expand on social influencers and the power in which they can impose on their users. Facebook has immense behavioral analysis tools that they can use to affect what their users do. Through sheer numbers testing, they can put themselves in a position of power that rivals ISPs. They are an example of how a centralization of data can provide power to a single entity that could prove dangerous in the wrong hands.
  
   The power of data is scary as in previous versions of the Internet, anonymity was almost gauranteed. Now, we find government agencies able to tap into data stashed away that could identify us online by just the behavior of our Internet usage. 
  
  The Internet is a scary, complex, and ever-developing place. We must tread lightly as a whole and not allow for big business to gain complete control over it. Their intentions are rooted in a desire to protect their assets and not necessarily to protect the users. A fully decentralized approach is again, foolish, but the basic principle should remain to provide the freedoms of innovation that built the Internet in the first place.
