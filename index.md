## Multi-Tussles

  The concept of tussle, just another word for conflict resolution really, posed by Clark in this paper revolves around the idea that different actors that utilize the Internet have different needs or uses for the Internet. The paper goes into detail describing the framework from the birth of the Internet and its end-to-end application development to where we are now. The Internet now while seemingly endless in nature, can still be affected to change as actors with different motives of use enter its realm. The multi-tussle idea that expands on Clark's framework points out that there are multiple conflicts of interest between actors within the Internet's development. These conflicts are not limited to technological needs but cover cultural needs and differences. 
  
  I believe what the objective of the paper is to point out how growing technology, in this case the entirety of the Internet, should be done with respect to a multitude of factors. I would agree that making a bit of software without considering the implications it may have is foolish. I would say the paper covers these implicatios in a very roundabout way, offering an almost philosophical approach to technology.

## Degrees of Freedom, Dimensions of Power

  The Internet has come a long way with the fundemental design being decentralization, we now find ourselves battling with big business objectives and a much more centralized design. Companies that provide Internet access have a scary amount of power in their hands. Privately owned, they can impose their power on a whim, provided there are no laws against it - which in the technologic expansion we're in now, are ever-growing. The article describes this potential imbalance of power as companies seek to structure and perfect their systems from unlawful users which is in direct conflict with the original Internet design. 
  
  While it may be obvious that a strictly wild west approach to the Internet would be disasterous, it was in this state of chaos that allowed for innovation and expansion. Powered with curiousity and freedom, software developers were able to work without restrictions in mind. However, malicious users could also impose this freedom to do harm. The difficulty in the direction the Internet must go falls under a struggle of power between freedom and regulations that restrict them. Allowing too much centralization of Internet power stifles the growth of technology, while not enough enables malicious users to do more harm.
  
  In a perfect world, there wouldn't be bad people. Unfortunately, there are more than people would like to consider. Ultimately, with enough power, it only takes one person to break everything if fail safes and protection aren't in place. 
  
  The paper goes on to expand on social influers and the power in which they can impose on their users. Facebook can
